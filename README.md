Projects from the Udemy course designed by Florin Pop and taught by Brad Traversy entitled 50 Projects: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Each project has its own repository.  The only files are html, css, and javascript.  There are no dependencies.  The results can be found at https://50-projects.com.  I have a link to each project with a quick description of what I learned from each project.


I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the beginning of 2020.  I started with Jon Duckett's books HTML & CSS and JavaScript & JQuery.  I then found the video course Modern JavaScript (Complete Guide, from Novice to Ninja) by Shaun Pelling, the NetNinja on the Udemy website.  I completed 85% of that course stopping when starting to work with APIs.  I then started learning WordPress to help a friend with his site, completing 70% of Gregg Davis and Rob Percival's The Complete Wordpress Business Course, also on Udemy.
