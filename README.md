Projects from the Udemy course designed by Florin Pop and taught by Brad Traversy entitled 50 Projects: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Each project has its own repository.  The only files are html, css, and javascript.  There are no dependencies.  The results can be found at https://50-projects.com.  I have a link to each project with a quick description of what I learned from each project.
